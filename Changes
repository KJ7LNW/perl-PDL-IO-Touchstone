Revision history for PDL-IO-Touchstone

1.015	2024-06-18T13:06:19-07:00
	- Fix false-negative test error (issue #6)

1.014	2023-02-26T15:49:37-08:00
	- Fix typos in Touchstone.pm and MDIF.pm
	- Fixed args cloning in rmdif
	- Removed unnecessary dummy dimension in m_to_pos_vecs
	- Use splice instead of an iterative shift in rmdif()

1.013	2022-11-14T21:58:23-08:00
	- Removed hash-based frequency interpolation It was buggy and hard to
	  work with.  The new format is far more flexible and easier to handle.
	  See POD C<m_interpolate>.

	- Extend frequency extrapolation in m_interpolate
	- Added wsnp_hash and rsnp_hash_to_list functions as an inverse to the
	  existing rsnp_list_to_hash functions.
	- Updated documentation and added tests

1.011	2022-11-04T17:08:35-07:00
	- Renamed rsnp_hash to rsnp_list_to_hash
	- Added rsnp_hash
	- Added rsnp_fh_hash
	- Note: This breaks compat with v1.010.

1.010	2022-10-31T19:15:01-07:00
	- Added support for single-frequency interpolation
	- Added rsnp_hash.

1.009	2022-10-30T18:24:52-07:00
	- Added PDL::IO::MDIF: Read and write Measurement Data Interchange Format
	- Fixed 5.26.3 CI test
	- Updated documentation.

1.008	2022-10-19T18:13:59-07:00
	- Add support for wsnp() to take n-port z0 vectors
	- Updated documentation to reference RF::Component
	- Fixed 1.007 changelog

1.007	2022-10-19T17:41:41-07:00
	- Fixed abcd_is* functions that were calling Re($pdl) instead of $pdl->re()
	- rsnp: Return a $z0 n-port vector from rsnp instead of a single-value scalar.
	- Added :ALL export tag
	- Added y_esr to EXPORT_OK
	- Added exports for m_to_pos_vecs and pos_vecs_to_m

1.006	2022-10-07T21:41:30-07:00
	- Added Y-parameter calculation functions for cap/inductance, etc
	- Added version dependency for PDL::LinearAlgebra 0.35
	- Add S-parameter interpolation support
	- Fixed ESR and Q calculations
	- Fixed self-resonant frequency calculation and added tests
	- Work-around for missing complex interpolation support in PDL <= 2.080

1.005	2022-08-05T19:50:07-07:00
	- Fixed missing Makefile.PL

1.004	2022-08-05T19:38:32-07:00
